# History
so one day i thought of the idea of creating a package manager for spwn then someone (specky?) suggested the name “pckp” so i named my project pckp then krista was making the cli because i gave permission but she didn’t understand my json api and then i made my own cli in python and i  left and became inactive for a few days (2 i think) and krista asked for permission to create  pckp and sput gave it to her and when i came back i renamed my package manager to spck
